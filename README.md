Welcome to the github-repositry *separable\_phase\_plane\_symmetries*! This project is entirely written in Python meaning that it is open-source, and our aim is that the results in the article entitled ``*Occam's razor gets a new edge: the use of symmetries in model selection*'' (**Reference to future article**) should be reproducable. Let's describe the project and all the relevant packages!
